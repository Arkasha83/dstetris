# DS Tetris #

## Release Notes ##

I have ported my Tetris for android code for use on the Nintendo DS, mostly to learn.

The game works but

-The menu has not been implemented so restarting the game after loosing is not activated.
-the code for the sound effects is in the game but I have had problems converting the sounds to the right format so sound is bugged
-score is not saved.
-I have not found out why but some times the build of the game will crash but a rebuild will fix it.

The rest works, I use the top screen to display the gameplay and the bottom screen for the interface.
Player can control the game using either classic buttons or virtual interface buttons.
Note : the game is designed to be played by turning your ds so that the right side of the console is the top and the left side is the bottom thus putting the gameplay screen on the left and the interface on the right.
